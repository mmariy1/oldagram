This project is part of the Frontend Career Path on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). It is supposed to be like an instagram feed. In this, the user can like the images by clicking twice on the post or by clicking on the like button. Check out the live version [here](https://oldagram-renaissance.netlify.app/) :)
